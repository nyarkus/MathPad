# MathPad

## Description

MathPad is a simple-to-use notebook that can perform some calculations. Just write what you need to calculate on a new line and put an equal sign at the end. MathPad will automatically calculate the result and display it after the equal sign.

## Features

1. **Calculations**: Just write a mathematical expression on a new line and put an equal sign at the end, and MathPad will calculate the result.

2. **Creating Variables**: You can create variables by writing the variable name at the beginning of the line, then an equal sign, and the value.

## Important Notes

If your text contains an equal sign, but you don't want MathPad to try to calculate this expression, write "//" at the beginning of the line to let MathPad know that this is your text, not an example for calculation.
